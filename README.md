# Project Euler Solution
* This project is the solution of problems in [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).
* A purpose of this project is to learn programming languages by doing something interesting.
* Pretty useful resources are provided below to help you learn languages used in this project.

## Language used
* [Go](https://golang.org/)
    * [Quickly learn features of Go](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/go/), enough for an experienced programmer to do things with Go.
    * [Book for beginner](https://www.golang-book.com/books/intro), can also act as a handbook.
    * [Playground](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1)
    * [Other resources](https://github.com/dariubs/GoBooks)
