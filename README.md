# Project Euler Solution
* This project is the solution of problems in [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).
* A purpose of this project is to learn programming languages by doing something interesting.
* Pretty useful resources are provided below to help you learn languages used in this project.

## Language used
* [Go](https://golang.org/)
    * [Quickly learn features of Go](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/go/), enough for an experienced programmer to do things with Go.
    * [Book for beginner](https://www.golang-book.com/books/intro), can also act as a handbook.
    * [Playground](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1).
    * [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html), another reference.
    * [Other resources](https://github.com/dariubs/GoBooks).
* C++
    * Some of the solution needs boost

## Resources that I find useful
* [Programming with Prime Numbers](https://programmingpraxis.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/primenumbers.pdf)
* [C++ Prime Generator](http://primesieve.org/segmented_sieve.html)
