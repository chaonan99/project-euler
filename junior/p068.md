I didn't write a program at all.

1. 16-digit means '10' should be outside the ring
2. To get the largest 16-digit number, as we are "starting from the group of three with the numerically lowest external node", it is best to keep 6,7,8,9,10 as external nodes and others internal. This gives the total sum `(1+2+3+4+5)*2 + 6+7+8+9+10 = 70`, so each group sums into `14`.
3. List all three groups that sum into 14 as follows
```
6,5,3; 6,3,5
9,4,1; 9,3,2; 9,2,3; 9,1,4
8,5,1; 8,4,2; 8,2,4; 8,1,5
7,5,2; 7,4,3; 7,3,4; 7,2,5
10,3,1; 10,1,3
```

Note that the order takes some priority.

4. Draw a tree to concatenate internal nodes. My tree for me looks like:
```
               2 - X
             /
           4- 1 - X
         /
5 - 3- 2 - 4 - X
         \ 
           1 - 4 - 2
```

5. 5-3-1-4-2 are concatenated through (6,5,3)-(10,3,1)-(9,1,4)-(8,4,2)-(7,2,5). Then you get the answer!
